All created files and folders have to go in the folder `architecture_center`

I need you to summarize the contents of the links that were provided to you in the selection. 
The summarization of the links has to be concise and easy to understand. It is to be used in preparation for the GCP PCA exam. It is crucial that the summarization matches the contents of the webpages. 
I would like to have bulletpoints, right to the point, and easy to read. I do not want any informations that wouldn't be useful for the exam or would be useful to me as an architect. 


Create folders that would contain md files that have the summaries of the links. 
The folders hierarchy should be the same as the links hierarchy. ( #### is within ###, ### is within ##, ## is within #) 
When you encounter a "(back to ...)", then that means we will go back to the parent folder, compared to the last file we created.
It is very important to conserve the order of the sections and their sub-sections/ links, this is why i would like you to add a prefix number to the folders and files, so i know which comes first, second, third, etc.

I insist that the results are for me to prepare in a very quick manner for the exam. and skip any technical details about implementations etc ... as the PCA exam doesn't require that level of detail.
