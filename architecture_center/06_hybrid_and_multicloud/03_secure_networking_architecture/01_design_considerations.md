# Hybrid/Multicloud Secure Networking - Design Considerations

## Key Considerations
*   **Connectivity**: VPN, Cloud Interconnect, or Partner Interconnect for hybrid; Cross-Cloud Interconnect for multicloud.
*   **Bandwidth**: Provision adequate capacity for workload requirements.
*   **Latency**: Dedicated interconnects offer lower latency than VPN.
*   **Security**: Encrypt traffic, use private IPs, firewall rules.
*   **HA/DR**: Redundant connections across multiple paths/locations.
*   **Cost**: Interconnect bandwidth and egress charges.
