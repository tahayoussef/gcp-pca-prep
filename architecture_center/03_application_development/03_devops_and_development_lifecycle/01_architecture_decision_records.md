# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview
**ADRs** are documents that capture important architectural decisions, their context, and rationale.

## When to Use ADRs
*   Significant architectural choices (e.g., choosing a database, microservices vs monolith).
*   Decisions that are difficult or costly to reverse.
*   When team needs to understand "why" a decision was made.

## ADR Format
*   **Title**: Short, descriptive name.
*   **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded.
*   **Context**: Problem statement and constraints.
*   **Decision**: What was decided.
*   **Consequences**: Trade-offs, benefits, and drawbacks.

## Benefits
*   **Knowledge Sharing**: New team members understand past decisions.
*   **Accountability**: Clear record of who decided what and why.
*   **Prevent Re-Litigation**: Avoid revisiting settled decisions.

## Best Practices
*   Store ADRs in version control (alongside code).
*   Keep ADRs concise and focused.
*   Number ADRs sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.).
