# DevOps Capabilities

## Overview
Key capabilities that drive high software delivery and organizational performance, based on **DORA** (DevOps Research and Assessment) research.

## Technical Capabilities
*   **Cloud Infrastructure**: Use cloud for elasticity and self-service provisioning.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated builds and tests on every commit.
*   **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automated deployment to production.
*   **Test Automation**: Comprehensive automated test suites.
*   **Trunk-Based Development**: Short-lived branches, frequent integration.
*   **Deployment Automation**: Push-button deployments.
*   **Loosely Coupled Architecture**: Microservices, APIs for independent deployment.
*   **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logs, traces for system health.
*   **Database Change Management**: Version-controlled schema changes.
*   **Shift Left on Security**: Security integrated early in development.

## Process Capabilities
*   **Small Batches**: Deploy small, incremental changes frequently.
*   **Customer Feedback**: Rapid feedback loops from users.
*   **Streamlined Change Approval**: Lightweight, automated approval processes.
*   **Visual Management**: Kanban boards for work visibility.
*   **WIP Limits**: Limit work in progress to improve flow.

## Cultural Capabilities
*   **Generative Culture**: Trust, collaboration, continuous learning.
*   **Job Satisfaction**: Employees feel valued and empowered.
*   **Learning Culture**: Encourage experimentation and learning from failure.
*   **Transformational Leadership**: Leaders inspire and support teams.

## Outcomes
*   Faster **deployment frequency**.
*   Shorter **lead time** for changes.
*   Lower **change failure rate**.
*   Faster **mean time to recovery (MTTR)**.
