# Set realistic targets for reliability

- **Principle Overview**
    - **100% Reliability is impractical**: It is prohibitively expensive and limits innovation.
    - **Goal**: Target a level of reliability that satisfies users ("happiness goal").

- **Accept Failure and Prioritize**
    - **Error Budget**: The gap between your target (e.g., 99.99%) and 100%. Use this budget to release features and take risks.
    - **Prioritization**: Set higher reliability targets for critical components vs. non-critical ones.

- **Balance Reliability and Cost**
    - Conduct **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Weigh the cost of higher availability against the business impact of downtime.
    - **Metrics**: Define **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) and **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) based on business needs and budget.
