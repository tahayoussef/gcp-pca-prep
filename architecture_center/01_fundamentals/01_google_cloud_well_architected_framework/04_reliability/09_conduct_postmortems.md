# Conduct thorough postmortems

- **Principle Overview**
    - **Postmortem**: A written record/analysis of an incident to prevent recurrence.
    - **Trigger**: Major downtime, data loss, SLO violation, or manual intervention (rollback).

- **Recommendations**
    - **Blameless Culture**: Focus on system flaws, process gaps, and tooling—not on individual human error. "You cannot fire your way to reliability."
    - **Actionable**: Output must include a plan to fix the root cause (e.g., "Automate this manual step", "Add alert for X").
    - **Share Widely**: Publish reports to the organization so other teams can learn from the failure.
