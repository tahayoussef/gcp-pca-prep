# Continuously monitor and improve performance

- **Principle Overview**
    - Performance is an ongoing process. Use tools to gather KPIs (Latency, Throughput, Error Rates) and iterate.

- **Define Goals**
    - **SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
    - **Targets**: Set baselines for response times and resource utilization.

- **Monitor Performance**
    - **Tools**: Use **Google Cloud Observability** (Profiler, Trace) to identify CPU/Memory hotspots. Use **Network Intelligence Center** to find network latency.
    - **Alerts**: Set up alerts for deviations from performance baselines.

- **Incentivize Improvement**
    - **Culture**: Encourage feedback and gamify KPIs.
    - **User Feedback**: Use frameworks like **HEART** (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task success) to measure user satisfaction quantitatively.
