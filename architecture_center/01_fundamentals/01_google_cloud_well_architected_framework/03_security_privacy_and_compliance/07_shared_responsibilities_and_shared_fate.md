# Shared responsibilities and shared fate on Google Cloud

- **Shared Responsibility Model**
    - **IaaS**: You manage OS, middleware, data, apps. Google manages hardware, physical net, storage infrastructure.
    - **PaaS**: Google manages more (runtime, OS patching). You manage data and app access.
    - **SaaS**: Google manages most (app, platform). You manage data and access policies.
    - Responsibilities also defined by **Industry** (PCI DSS, HIPAA) and **Location** (GDPR).

- **Shared Fate**
    - Active partnership where Google helps you be secure, rather than just shifting blame.
    - **Blueprints**: **Enterprise Foundations Blueprint**, Secured Data Warehouse (secure-by-default IaC).
    - **Landing Zones**: Guides for hierarchy, network, and identity setup.
    - **Risk Protection Program**: **Cyber Insurance Hub** (connects with insurers like Munich Re/Allianz).

- **Putting it into Practice**
    - Use **Organization Policies** and **Assured Workloads** for governance.
    - Monitor with **Security Command Center Premium** and **Policy Intelligence**.
    - Verify responsibilities using the **Compliance Resource Center**.
