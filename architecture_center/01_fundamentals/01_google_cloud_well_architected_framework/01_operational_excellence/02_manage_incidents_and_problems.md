# Manage incidents and problems

- **Foundational Elements**
    - Effective incident management relies on **Continuous Monitoring**, **Automation**, **Orchestration**, and **Data-driven insights**.

- **Establish Clear Incident Response Procedures**
    - Define clear roles (e.g., Incident Commander) and responsibilities.
    - Establish communication protocols and escalation paths.
    - Document execution steps in **Runbooks** or **Playbooks** (standardized reference guides).

- **Centralize Incident Management**
    - Use a centralized system to track incidents, enabling improved visibility and collaboration.
    - Eliminates context switching and provides a comprehensive view for stakeholders.
    - Enhances accountability and ownership of tasks.

- **Conduct Thorough Post-Incident Reviews (Postmortems)**
    - Conduct **Blameless Postmortems** to identify root causes and lessons learned, not to assign blame.
    - Create a report including:
        - Timeline of events.
        - Root cause analysis (immediate and systemic causes).
        - Recommended corrective actions.
    - Share findings to prevent recurrence and improve procedures.

- **Maintain a Knowledge Base**
    - Repository of known issues, solutions, and troubleshooting guides.
    - Enables teams to resolve common problems quickly and reduces escalation.
    - Should be easily accessible and regularly updated.

- **Automate Incident Response**
    - Use tools (e.g., **Cloud Run functions**, **Cloud Run**) to streamline detection and remediation.
    - **Benefits**:
        - Reduced detection/resolution times.
        - Reduced burden on operations teams (automating routine tasks).
        - Consistent application of remediation actions (e.g., isolating compromised systems).
