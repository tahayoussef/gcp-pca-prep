# FSI perspective: Operational excellence

- **SLAs and Reliability Criteria**
    - **Metrics**: Define **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) and **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) for compliance.
    - **SRE Practices**: Implement **SLIs** (Service Level Indicators) and **SLOs** (Service Level Objectives) to objectively measure system health (e.g., 99.9% availability).

- **Incident Management & Resilience**
    - **Testing**: Regularly perform **Stress Testing** and **Chaos Engineering** to ensure systems withstand market volatility and peak loads.
    - **Capacity Planning**: Use performance data to anticipate future needs and prevent bottlenecks.

- **Continuous Improvement**
    - **Innovation**: Leverage AI/ML for fraud detection and risk analysis.
    - **Agility**: Adopt cloud-native technologies to adapt quickly to regulatory changes.
