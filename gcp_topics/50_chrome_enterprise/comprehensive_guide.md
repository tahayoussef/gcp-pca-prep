# Chrome Enterprise - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
**Chrome Enterprise** offers management tools for the Chrome browser and ChromeOS devices. The key feature for the PCA exam is **Chrome Browser Cloud Management (CBCM)**, which allows centralized policy enforcement across any OS (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Key Features
- **Centralized Management**: Manage browser policies (home page, extensions, proxy) from Google Admin Console.
- **Extension Management**: Block/Allow specific extensions, force install extensions.
- **Security**: "Zero Trust" capabilities, data loss prevention (via Chrome Enterprise Premium).
- **Kiosk Mode**: Run a single app in full screen, locked down (common exam scenario for retail/public terminals).

## Exam Focus Areas

1.  **Scenario**: "Need to ensure all employees have a specific security extension installed on their browser, regardless of their OS." -> **Chrome Browser Cloud Management** (Force-install policy).
2.  **Scenario**: "Retail store needs a public-facing device that only shows the store catalog." -> **ChromeOS Kiosk Mode**.
3.  **Scenario**: "Need to block users from downloading executables." -> **Safe Browsing** policies in Chrome Enterprise.
